# Ecommerce-Website
The project was developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In this website we can select phones and see the specifications.
In this project I created a E-commerce website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap where users can login first and then they 
can choose the accessories according to their budget and after that they can see the specification of particular product.
At the end of specification I provided a link from where they can buy the product.
I used HTML,CSS and Bootstrap to make it better design and responsive. 
I learnt bootstrap from this website and wherever i was unable to perform forward 
I took help online from W3school.com website and completed this website.
